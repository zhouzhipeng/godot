		A region of the 2D navigation map.
	</brief_description>
	<description>
		A region of the navigation map. It tells the [NavigationServer2D] what can be navigated and what cannot, based on its [NavigationPolygon] resource.
		Two regions can be connected to each other if they share a similar edge. You can set the minimum distance between two vertices required to connect two edges by using [method NavigationServer2D.map_set_edge_connection_margin].
		[b]Note:[/b] Overlapping two regions' polygons is not enough for connecting two regions. They must share a similar edge.
		The pathfinding cost of entering this region from another region can be controlled with the [member enter_cost] value.
		[b]Note[/b]: This value is not added to the path cost when the start position is already inside this region.
		The pathfinding cost of traveling distances inside this region can be controlled with the [member travel_cost] multiplier.

		<method name="get_region_rid" qualifiers="const">
			<return type="RID" />
			<description>
				Returns the [RID] of this region on the [NavigationServer2D]. Combined with [method NavigationServer2D.map_get_closest_point_owner] can be used to identify the [NavigationRegion2D] closest to a point on the merged navigation map.
